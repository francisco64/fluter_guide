# Flutter Video Discovery App

This project is a Flutter application designed to emulate a TikTok-like video discovery experience. It features a vertically scrollable video feed, user interactions such as liking and sharing, and the ability to view videos in full screen. Below, you will find an in-depth explanation of the project's key components, including the relationships between various widgets and why they are necessary.


## Key Concepts and Widget Relationships

### main.dart

**Main Entry Point of the App**

The `main.dart` file serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the app, sets up the theme, and specifies the first screen to display.

- **MyApp Class**: This is the root widget of the application, which is crucial as it provides the initial setup for the app.
- **MaterialApp Widget**: This widget wraps around the entire application, defining global settings such as the theme and navigation structure.

#### Key Methods and Widgets

| Method/Widget            | Description                                                                                  | Reference URL                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `runApp()`               | Bootstraps the Flutter application.                                                          | [runApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/runApp.html) |
| `MaterialApp`            | A convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets commonly required for applications.      | [MaterialApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html) |

**Relationship**: The `MaterialApp` widget is essential because it encapsulates the entire app, providing critical configurations like theming and navigation, which are used by all screens and widgets within the app.

### discover_screen.dart

**The Core Screen of the App**

This screen displays the main content of the appâ€”a scrollable feed of video posts. It interacts with the `DiscoverProvider` to fetch videos and manage their state.

- **DiscoverScreen Class**: This is the central screen that users interact with, displaying the video feed.
- **VideoScrollableView**: A custom widget that handles the vertical scrolling of videos.

#### Key Methods and Widgets

| Method/Widget            | Description                                                                                  | Reference URL                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Scaffold`               | Implements the basic material design visual layout structure.                                | [Scaffold](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html) |
| `VideoScrollableView`    | A custom widget that manages the scrolling of video posts.                                   | -                                                  |

**Relationship**: The `DiscoverScreen` relies on `VideoScrollableView` to manage the scrolling of video posts. This separation of concerns allows the `DiscoverScreen` to focus on the overall layout and presentation, while `VideoScrollableView` handles the scrolling mechanics.

### discover_provider.dart

**State Management**

The `DiscoverProvider` is a state management class that handles the logic of fetching videos, managing the list of videos, and notifying the UI about changes.

- **DiscoverProvider Class**: Manages the state of the video discovery screen, including the list of videos and loading more content.
- **ChangeNotifier**: A base class that provides change notifications to its listeners, making it essential for updating the UI when the state changes.

#### Key Methods and Widgets

| Method/Widget            | Description                                                                                  | Reference URL                                      |
